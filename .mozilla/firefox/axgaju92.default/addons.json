If so, then read carefully before filing any issue.\n\n***\n\nAn efficient blocker: easy on memory and CPU footprint, and yet can load and enforce thousands more filters than other popular blockers out there.\n\nIllustrated overview of its efficiency: https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/uBlock-vs.-ABP:-efficiency-compared\n\nUsage: The big power button in the popup is to permanently disable/enable uBlock for the current web site. It applies to the current web site only, it is not a global power button.\n\n***\n\nFlexible, it's more than an \"ad blocker\": it can also read and create filters from hosts files.\n\nOut of the box, these lists of filters are loaded and enforced:\n\n- EasyList\n- Peter Lowe’s Ad server list\n- EasyPrivacy\n- Malware domains\n\nMore lists are available for you to select if you wish:\n\n- Fanboy’s Enhanced Tracking List\n- Dan Pollock’s hosts file\n- hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers\n- MVPS HOSTS\n- Spam404\n- And many others\n\nOf course, the more filters enabled, the higher the memory footprint. Yet, even after adding Fanboy's two extra lists, hpHosts’s Ad and tracking servers, uBlock Origin still has a lower memory footprint than other very popular blockers out there.\n\nAlso, be aware that selecting some of these extra lists may lead to higher likelihood of web site breakage -- especially those lists which are normally used as hosts file.\n\n***\n\nFree.\nOpen source with public license (GPLv3)\nFor users by users.\n\nIf ever you really do want to contribute something, think about the people working hard to maintain the filter lists you are using, which were made available to use by all for free.\n\n***\n\nDocumentation:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin\n\nProject change log:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases\n\nContributors @ Github:\nhttps://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/graphs/contributors\n\nContributors @ Crowdin:\nhttps://crowdin.net/project/ublock","weeklyDownloads":225964,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Raymond Hill","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/gorhill/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157572.png?modified=1530209230","width":640,"height":480,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157572.png?modified=1530209230","thumbnailWidth":267,"thumbnailHeight":200,"caption":"Default mode"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157576.png?modified=1530209230","width":640,"height":480,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157576.png?modified=1530209230","thumbnailWidth":267,"thumbnailHeight":200,"caption":"The dashboard: stock filter lists"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/157/157592.png?modified=1530209231","width":640,"height":480,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/157/157592.png?modified=1530209231","thumbnailWidth":267,"thumbnailHeight":200,"caption":"Dynamic filtering allows default-deny mode"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/159/159634.png?modified=1530209231","width":640,"height":480,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/159/159634.png?modified=1530209231","thumbnailWidth":267,"thumbnailHeight":200,"caption":"The dashboard: settings"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/158/158734.png?modified=1530209232","width":700,"height":525,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/158/158734.png?modified=1530209232","thumbnailWidth":267,"thumbnailHeight":200,"caption":"Unified logger"}],"contributionURL":null,"averageRating":4.6029,"reviewCount":3116,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/reviews/","updateDate":1538262214000},{"id":"foxyproxy@eric.h.jung","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/2/2464-32.png?modified=mcrushed","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/2/2464-64.png?modified=mcrushed"},"name":"FoxyProxy Standard","version":"6.3","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/969185/foxyproxy_standard-6.3-an+fx.xpi?src=","size":1350380,"homepageURL":"http://getfoxyproxy.org","supportURL":"http://getfoxyproxy.org/","description":"FoxyProxy is an advanced proxy management tool that completely replaces Firefox's limited proxying capabilities. For a simpler tool and less advanced configuration options, please use FoxyProxy Basic.","fullDescription":"WHAT IS IT?\nFoxyProxy is a Firefox extension which automatically switches an internet connection across one or more proxy servers based on URL patterns. Put simply, FoxyProxy automates the manual process of editing Firefox's Connection Settings dialog. Proxy server switching occurs based on the loading URL and the switching rules you define.\n\nUPGRADING\nPlease import your old FoxyProxy settings using the Import button!\n\nOlder Firefox Versions\nInstall FoxyProxy 4.6.5. from here:\nhttps://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard/versions/\nNote: 4.6.5 is not maintained.\n\nPERMISSIONS\nThe \"Download files\" permission is used to export FoxyProxy settings to a file (so you can import it elsewhere). The \"Download history\" permission is required only because Firefox does not allow add-ons to specify just \"download files\" without \"download history\". It's all or nothing. Internally, nothing is done with your download history. This is open source software and you can view the code yourself by unzipping the downloaded then using a text viewer.\n\n\"Clear recent browsing history, cookies, and related data\": this is used by the big eraser button since version 6.3. You can delete cookies, cache, etc with one-click. Next version will allow you to clear the data automatically when switching proxies, just like the old FoxyProxy (pre-Firefox Quantum / Firefox 57). Download history is NOT cleared, so we do not need that permission. It will be removed shortly. It was added by mistake.\n\nANDROID\nSince Firefox on Android does not support the proxyAPI, FoxyProxy does not work. This is a limitation of Firefox on Android, not FoxyProxy. There are currently no Firefox for Android add-ons which manipulate proxy settings.\n\n    Switch proxies with URL pattern matching\n    Custom colors make it easy to see which proxy is in use\n    Advanced logging shows you which proxies were used and when\n    (optional) Automatically synchronize all of your proxy settings with your other Firefox instances when you use Firefox Sync.
